This is a summary for linear Algebra needed for CV

## Linear Algebra Primer

Vectors have two main uses
Data (pixels, gradients at an image keypoint, etc) can also be treated as a vector  Such vectors don’t  have a geometric interpretaLon, but calculaLons like 
“distance” can  have value.

MATLAB represents an image as a matrix of pixel brightnesses

Color Images 
 - Grayscale images have one number per pixel, and are stored as an m × n matrix. 
 - Color images have 3 numbers per pixel – red, green, and blue brightnesses (RGB).
 - Stored as an m × n × 3 matrix.
 
### Transformation Matrices

Matrices can be used to transform vectors in useful ways, through mulLplication: x’= Ax

- 2D RotaLon Matrix Formula.
- Counter-clockwise rotation by an angle θ.

Multiple transformation matrices can be used to transform a point: 
p’=R2 R1 S p

This is sufficient for scale, rotate, skew transformations.

## SVD (Singular Value Decomposition)
In linear algebra, the singular value decomposition (SVD) is a factorization of a real or complex matrix. It is used for many application such as image compression.

Images as functions
- Linear systems (filters)
- Convolution and correlation

- Images are usually digital (discrete):
 – Sample the 2D space on a regular grid
 - Represented as a matrix of integer values

Systems and Filters
• Filtering:
 – Form a new image whose pixels are a combination original pixel values Goals: 
-Extract useful information from the images
 - Features (edges, corners, blobs…)
 - Modify or enhance image properties: 
 - super-resolution; in-painting; de-noising

##### Convolution vs. (Cross) Correlation
- A convolution is an integral that expresses the amount  of overlap of one function as it is shifted over another 
function. 
###### convolution is a filtering operation
- Correlation compares the similarity of two sets of data. Correlation computes a measure of similarity of 
two input signals as they are shifted by one another. The correlation result reaches a maximum at the time 
when the two signals match best .
[b]correlation is a measure of relatedness of two signals[/b]


## Edge detectoin 
-  A simple edge detector 
-  Canny edge detector 
-  A model fiMng method for edge detec.on 
– RANSAC

#### Characterizing edges 
•  An edge is a place of rapid change in the image intensity function.

Smoothing the image should help, by forcing pixels different to their neighbors (=noise pixels?) 
to look more like neighbors.

Designing an edge detector 
-  Criteria for an “op.mal” edge detector: 
–  Good detec,on: the op.mal detector must minimize the probability of 
false posi.ves (detec.ng spurious edges caused by noise), as well as that 
of false nega.ves (missing real edges) 
–  Good localiza,on: the edges detected must be as close as possible to 
the true edges 
–  Single response: the detector must return one point only for each true 
edge point; that is, minimize the number of local maxima around the 
true edge


Canny edge detector

Canny has shown that the first deriva.ve of the Gaussian closely approximates the operator that op.mizes the product of signal-to-noise ra7o and localization
