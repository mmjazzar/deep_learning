This is a summary for linear Algebra needed for CV

## Linear Algebra Primer

Vectors have two main uses
Data (pixels, gradients at an image keypoint, etc) can also be treated as a vector  Such vectors don’t  have a geometric interpretaLon, but calculaLons like 
“distance” can  have value.

MATLAB represents an image as a matrix of pixel brightnesses

Color Images 
 - Grayscale images have one number per pixel, and are stored as an m × n matrix. 
 - Color images have 3 numbers per pixel – red, green, and blue brightnesses (RGB).
 - Stored as an m × n × 3 matrix.
 
### Transformation Matrices

Matrices can be used to transform vectors in useful ways, through mulLplication: x’= Ax

- 2D RotaLon Matrix Formula.
- Counter-clockwise rotation by an angle θ.

Multiple transformation matrices can be used to transform a point: 
p’=R2 R1 S p

This is sufficient for scale, rotate, skew transformations.
